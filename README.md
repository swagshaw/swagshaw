Welcome to my GitHub. I'm Yang Xiao(è‚–æ‰¬) or you can call me Jan (which is same pronunciation as Yang). I research speech and audio for the [Fortemedia](https://www.fortemedia.com/). Before that I graduated as the Master of Artificial Intelligence at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). My research lies at building efficient, robust, data-centric machine learning system. At this moment, I mainly work in the data-centric speech system that are continual, real-time and efficient.
