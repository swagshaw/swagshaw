Welcome to my GitHub. I'm Yang Xiao or you can call me Austin. I am a PhD student at the University of Melbourne. I also researched speech and audio for the [Fortemedia](https://www.fortemedia.com/). Before that, I graduated with a Master of Artificial Intelligence at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). 
<!-- My research is building an efficient, robust, data-centric machine learning system. At this moment, I mainly work in data-centric speech systems that are continual, real-time, and efficient.-->
